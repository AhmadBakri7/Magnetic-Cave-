## Game Description

Magnetic Cave is a strategic two-player game played on an 8x8 chessboard where each player aims to create a "bridge" of five magnetic bricks. Each player is represented by different symbols:
- Player 1: ■
- Player 2: □

### Game Rules
1. The board starts empty.
2. Players take turns, starting with Player 1 (■).
3. Bricks must be placed directly next to the left or right wall or adjacent to another brick.
4. The goal is to align five consecutive bricks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
5. The game ends when a player achieves the goal or the board is full, resulting in a tie if no bridges are formed.
